    <h1>
        Welcome to Victoria's Restaurant
    </h1>

    <p>
        Victoria's Restaurant began as a stubborn little idea sketched on the back of
        a napkin by Victoria Mulugeta after a rainy day farmers' market when she swapped
        stories (and recipes) with an old chef who taught her the perfect roast. She
        spent a summer restoring an abandoned carriage house, planting herbs in the
        courtyard, and inviting neighbors over for Sunday suppers that quickly turned
        into long lines and warm, loud dinners. The menu blends her abuela's slow-cooked
        stews with bright, market-driven salads and a rotating pastry that became the
        town's obsession. What started as a handful of shared meals grew into a cozy,
        lantern-lit dining room where regulars still trade recipe tweaks over espressoâ€”and
        where every dish arrives with a small story.
